## 🌟 Abstract
This project presents an AI-powered system for **automatic detection of grapevine leaf diseases**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the system identifies whether a grape leaf is **Healthy** or affected by diseases like:
- 🍂 **Black Rot**
- 🍂 **Esca (Black Measles)**
- 🍂 **Leaf Blight (Isariopsis)**

The model is trained on **Kaggle datasets**, integrated into a **Flask Web Application**, and provides real-time predictions for farmers and researchers.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ **Upload & Diagnose** – Farmers can upload leaf images to get instant results  
- ✅ **High Accuracy Model** – CNN trained with augmented data for better performance  
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard** – Visualize dataset distribution & accuracy curves  
- ✅ **Lightweight Deployment** – Flask-based web app, easy to run anywhere  
- ✅ **Scalable** – Can be extended to detect other crop diseases
